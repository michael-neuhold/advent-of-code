# 🎄🎄🎄 Advent Of Code (AOC) 2021 🎄🎄🎄
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
